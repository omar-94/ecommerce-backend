## Description
As an internet retailer, I want to use the latest back-end technologies for my website to create, update, and delete data in my database. Using technologies such as node.js, express.js, and sequelize in this node application, allows for such CRUD capablities.

## Installation
To run application you will need to clone the repository to local machine.   
Install **node.js** and run the following in terminal:
```
npm i
```
The necessary dependencies will download and install.  
Run 'schema.sql' file in MySQL Workbench to create database.  
Create a .env file following the example and update necessary credentials.
```
DB_USER=''
DB_PW=''
DB_NAME='ecommerce_db'
```
Seed your database by running the following in terminal:
```
npm run seed
```
Start server by running the following in terminal:
```
npm start
```
Once server is listening, open Insomnia Core to create, update, delete data using the routes created.
